Gesture-Based Pick and Drop System

This repository contains the code and resources for a Gesture-Based Pick and Drop System. The project leverages computer vision and hardware integration to enable users to interact with a robotic arm or similar mechanism using gestures, providing an intuitive and touch-free interface.

Features

Gesture Recognition: Detect and classify gestures in real-time using a webcam or sensor.

Robotic Arm Control: Map gestures to specific pick-and-drop actions for a robotic mechanism.

User-Friendly Interface: Visual feedback for the gestures recognized and actions performed.

Customizable Gestures: Easily modify gestures and their corresponding actions.

Technologies Used

Hardware

Robotic arm (or similar pick-and-drop mechanism).

Webcam or gesture detection sensor (e.g., Leap Motion, Kinect).

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) for hardware control.


Software

Programming Language: Python.

Libraries and Frameworks:

OpenCV: For gesture recognition.

Mediapipe: For advanced hand and gesture tracking.

PySerial: For communication with the microcontroller.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/gesture-pick-drop-system.git  
cd gesture-pick-drop-system


2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Connect the hardware components and ensure the microcontroller is properly set up.




---

Usage

1. Run the gesture recognition program:

python gesture_control.py


2. Follow on-screen instructions to calibrate your gestures.


3. Use predefined gestures to control the pick-and-drop mechanism.

Customization

Add New Gestures

1. Modify the gestures.json file to include new gestures and their corresponding actions.


2. Update the code in gesture_control.py to handle new gestures.



Adjust Robotic Arm Movements

1. Edit the Arduino/Raspberry Pi script in the hardware/ directory to change movement logic.
